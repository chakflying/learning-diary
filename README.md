# My Learning Diary

Hosted on Github Pages [here](https://chakflying.github.io/learning-diary/).

Template and theme provided by [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

No building neccessary, as Github automatically work with a Jekyll folder structure, and the .md files in  `_posts` directory gets converted to articles on the page.
